                <h1>Pajaro Park Mural</h1>

                <p>This wall, measuring at a solid 300 feet, is a great example of
                   creatives coming together collaboratively to create space and
                    beautify the community.  The Arts Council for Monterey County
                     has done marvelously in their mission to bring arts to the school
                      systems in our area. </p>

              <p>Artistic director/ professor Johanna Poethig, with the help
                of alumni and students of the visual public art department
                 at CSUMB, were able to design public works at large scale.
                 Special thanks to Gail and also our friends from the Art Council.</p>

                <p>Professional development was definitely happening in every level of
                   education, it was also a great treat to work with Jose Ortiz and his
                    students on this new recreational facility located in the heart of
                     a largely farmworker community.</p>

              <p>The artworks of children in Pajaro schools, working with Kenji were used
                as references.  Itâ€™s a very powerful thing for children to see their little
                 drawings as monuments and say to themselves, we did that. If you are in the
                  Neighborhood definitely check it out.  A little bit of every individual
                   involved in this mural shines through and bright.  Also a revolutionary
                    method was used for installation which proved to be very efficient.</p>
