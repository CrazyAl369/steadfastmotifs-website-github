                <h1>Marina Highschool Mural</h1>
                <p>Working on the Marina High School Mural was one of my favorite experiences at
                  CSUMB. I was enrolled in a large scale painting and mural course and part of the classwork 
                  consisted of rendering a mural at the Marina High School.</p>

                <!--<p>The design for this mural was approved a year prior to painting
                   and most of the students painting did work together to conceptualize
                    a new mural idea for a new location to be painted and rendered by
                     the new students to enroll in the large scale painting and mural
                      class in the following semester.</p>-->

          <p>Judy Baca (on the left) blessed us with good vibes today. She is an artist,
             activist, and Professor of Chicano Studies and World Arts & Cultures.

          <p>We met just a couple days a week but
             the project came together very quickly.

          the bottom right of the second image.</p>

          <p>Collaborating is beautiful, especially under
             Johanna Poethig's instruction. Non-woven medium application
            was practiced on this project. This process allows us to attach
          a painted image onto most surfaces.</p>

          <p>Passing period just got a lot more colorful. This mural will really bring
            the students together. No more staring at blank walls, now there is a sea of color
            to captivate the minds and hearts of the young scholars attend the Marina High School.

          <p>The large scale painting and mural classes from the 
            The Visual and Public Art department have been
              cranking out projects like clockwork. Non-woven
               medium application was practiced in large scale
                mural and made quick work of otherwise time consuming
                 and logistically challenging processes. </p>-
