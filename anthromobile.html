                     A good reason why I scaled down was to make my project fall within the parameters and dimensions of a
                     small area in the university center at csumb.

                        My work is an exploration of visual communication, the ancient and continuously evolving technology that
                         revolutionized the way humans express themselves. To illustrate how this technology has evolved, my work
                          shows a link between ancient forms of visual communication and the contemporary forms of our technology’s
                           communication design.  I noticed that both ancient and current visual communications share characteristics
                            like shape, form, and alignment and also share the use of tablets as common interfacial elements of visual
                             design.  The Ancient Sumerians developed cuneiform script, one of the world’s earliest systems of writing,
                              which they inscribed on clay tablets to record and share information; we continue to use tablets today,
                               but it is now our mobile devices and handheld tablets that record and share our information. I chose to
                                build a cell phone with hieroglyph-like applications made out of clay to express the idea that visual
                                 communication is in a constant state of evolution and rediscovery.  When reflecting on the development
                                  of Ancient and complex writing systems into simplified versions where some of their characters became 
                                  modified or became obsolete, it became easy for me to see that the same thing happens now with the shorthand
                                   texting language and constantly developing social networking applications that we use on our tablets.

                    the completion of my project.  The pressure was definitely on in my 
                    second semester and my aim was to have one piece that is made up of
